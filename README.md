# terraform-random-id

Demo of the Terraform [`random_id` resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/random/r/id.html).
This is useful for figuring out which `byte_length` to use, and which attribute best represents the random string you want.

You can view the [`terraform.tfstate`](https://github.com/justincampbell/terraform-random-id/raw/master/terraform.tfstate) in this repo instead of running it locally.

Locally, you can run `terraform show` to inspect the state.
